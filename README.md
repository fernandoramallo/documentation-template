## About

This is a ready-to-use Jekyll set up with a table of contents you can start editing to add pages.

Set up [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and run localserver to start a testing version at http://localhost:4000

## Thanks
Inspired/based on the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/) because I stare at it all day.

Thanks to @kevinw for ummm most of the setup.
