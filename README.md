# Simple Documentation!
A quick template for making a project's documentation page using markdown.

## About

This is a ready-to-use Jekyll set up with a table of contents you can start editing to add pages.
Inspired/based on the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/) because I stare at it all day.


Thanks to @kevinw for ummm most of the setup
